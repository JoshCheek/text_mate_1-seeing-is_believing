Seeing Is Believing

Installation
------------

This uses git to get the code, but really any way you get the code into this dir is fine,
you could download and unzip it, for example.

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
    git clone git://github.com:JoshCheek/text_mate_1-seeing-is_believing.git Seeing\ Is\ Believing
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
